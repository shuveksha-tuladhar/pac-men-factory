# Pac Men Factory

## Description 
This creates PacMen with the click of a button and each of them will move about the browser window at their own pace. This was developed a part of MIT Full Stack Bootcamp Project. The starter code and images were provided. 

## Here's how the game works

- "Add PacMan" button: A new pacman should appear at a random position on the screen on every click.
- "Start Game" button: The pacman or pacmen created should start moving at random velocity on the screen.
- When a given pacman hits the edge of the screen, it should change position to stay within the frame of the web page.
